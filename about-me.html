                <h2>Iâ€™m Brodric Young,</h2>
                <p>I grew up in a small town in Utah called Duchesne where I learned the value of hard work through my jobs and chores over the summer as well as academically in high school. Some of these jobs included building add-ons to people's homes, where I gained a great interest in woodworking and constructing things. I've built on that interst of creating things and incorperated it into my college studies and projects by creating designs, circuits, and applications that would be useful to others. As I've pursued my degree in computer engineering, I've come to love working on projects and labs to build my knowledge of the field in hopes of becoming capable to make a difference in the world and better other peoples lives.</p>
                <p>I also served as a missionary for the church I affiliate with in order to help more people. I spent two years in the countries of Zambia and Malawi in Africa teaching people and serving them in a number of ways. Through this service, as well as doing various sports, previouos jobs, and college courses, I've gained much experience in working in a team and learning to cooperate and communicate with other people.</p>
                <p>After I finish my Bachelors degree in computer engineering in April 2026, I'll be seeking a job where I can use the knowledge and skills I've learned to make the world a better place and support my family.</p>
